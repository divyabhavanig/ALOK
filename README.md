App to assist visually impared in daily tasks like Text reading and object detection As technology advances and data collection becomes more cost-effective, the challenge for developers lies in efficiently processing and utilizing the vast amounts of data generated. For applications aimed at improving accessibility for blind users, leveraging advanced machine learning techniques is crucial. In this context, ALOK utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning models, specifically Google ML Kit and YOLO, to deliver robust text recognition and object detection capabilities. These technologies are pivotal in transforming visual information into auditory descriptions, significantly enhancing user experience and accessibility.

Despite the progress in machine learning, a critical bottleneck remains in the effective utilization of unlabelled data, which is essential for training supervised models. ALOK addresses this challenge by employing active learning strategies to optimize the labeling process. By applying active learning techniques such as Least Confidence, Margin Sampling, and Entropy Sampling, ALOK selectively improves the quality of its training data. This iterative approach ensures that the most informative data points are labeled and incorporated, thus refining the model's performance and enhancing its accuracy in recognizing and describing text and objects.

The effectiveness of ALOK's approach is demonstrated through its performance metrics. For instance, initial training on full datasets yielded significant results, with the app achieving a high degree of accuracy in text recognition and object detection. By leveraging active learning, ALOK optimizes the labeling process, resulting in more efficient training with a reduced number of samples. This method not only enhances the modelâ€™s accuracy but also minimizes the data labeling effort, showcasing active learning as a powerful technique for improving machine learning applications in accessibility technology.
